## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **high-performance, real-time Smart Security Surveillance System** using FPGA technology.  
It integrates a **Spartan-6 FPGA** with a **PIR motion sensor** and an **ESP32-CAM module** to enable efficient motion detection and live video streaming.  

The system leverages **VHDL** for hardware design to achieve low latency, enhanced power efficiency, and robust real-time processing — making it ideal for embedded surveillance applications such as smart homes, industrial safety, and agricultural monitoring.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **PIR Sensor Monitoring** — Continuously detects motion.  
2. **FPGA Processing** — Processes PIR input and initiates video streaming.  
3. **ESP32-CAM Activation** — Streams live video via Wi-Fi.  
4. **Alert Notification** — FPGA sends alert to user with live feed link.  
5. **User Access** — View live stream through web interface.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Hardware Setup

1. **Connect PIR sensor:**
   - Power supply (3.3V or 5V) to sensor.
   - Output signal → FPGA GPIO input.
   - Ground → FPGA GND.

2. **Connect ESP32-CAM:**
   - Power supply 5V (or 3.3V per specification).
   - UART interface → FPGA RX/TX lines.
   - Ground → FPGA GND.

### Software Setup

1. Open the VHDL project in a compatible FPGA development environment (e.g., Xilinx ISE).  
2. Compile and synthesize targeting the Spartan-6 FPGA.  
3. Program the FPGA with the generated bitstream.  
4. Deploy HTML interface files to a web host or local server.
